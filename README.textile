Since Haiti I have been doing a lot of reading on disaster response and recovery. Today I needed to load a "GeoRSS":http://www.georss.org/ feed from USGS(US Geological Survey). They publish the location of earthquakes as a GeoRSS feed. They also publish a product called "ShakeMaps":http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/. This is a fantastic product since it provides a map of the actual "ground shaking" a not just the simplistic magnitude and epicentre. Creating a ShakeMap is a function of local geology, epicentre, magnitude and many other variables. You can read about it "here":http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/background.php. ShakeMap are thus much more useful from a disaster response and recovery point-of-view. For example if you have the necessary data on geology and population exposure you can run a model that simulates an earthquake over a region to predict the likely effect on the population.   

Getting back to the GeoRSS - the ShakeMap feed allows us to integrate this into any web mapping application thus creating interesting mashups. E.g. overlaying it with socio-economic or population exposure or vulnerability data to show the simulation results I mention above. 

Okay so I'll show you how to set up a GeoRSS feed parser using "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/.  Here is the "ShakeMap as GeoRSS Feed":http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/rss.xml. You will need ruby and sinatra installed. 

Here is the code for the routes in sinatra:

bc. require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'open-uri'

bc. get '/' do
  haml :shakemaps
end

bc. get '/proxy' do
  open params["url"]
end

When the client hits the our root url (/) we will render the OpenLayers map with the USGS ShakeMap. We may also want to let people add other feeds. 

Shoaib, some tests from the git workshop :o) .... please dont publish.

So in our "shakemaps.rb":http://github.com/sabman/ShakeMaps/blob/master/shakemaps.rb the first route is to the root. This is pretty simple, when the root of the app is hit the server renders the shakemaps "haml":http://haml-lang.com/ template. The "haml template":http://github.com/sabman/ShakeMaps/blob/master/views/shakemaps.haml loads our "javascript":http://github.com/sabman/ShakeMaps/blob/master/public/js/shakemaps.js to render the OpenLayers map. This javascript also calls the shakemap GeoRSS feed via a proxy. The proxy is needed because OpenLayers which is a javascript library isn't allowed cross-site-server calls. The proxy is where the second method in @shakemaps.rb@ comes along. It looks for the parameter url at the end of the URI and simply opens it. This is the GeoRSS XML feed. Finally there is a form allowing us to point to other GeoRSS feeds.
